/**
 * VH and VW units can cause issues on iOS devices: http://caniuse.com/#feat=viewport-units
 *
 * To overcome this, create media queries that target the width, height, and orientation of iOS devices.
 * It isn't optimal, but there is really no other way to solve the problem. In this example, I am fixing
 * the height of element `.h-screen-ios` â€”which is a full width and height cover image.
